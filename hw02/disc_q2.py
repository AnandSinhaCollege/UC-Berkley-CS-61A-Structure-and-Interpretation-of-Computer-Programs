Q2: Jacket Weather?
Alfonso will only wear a jacket outside if it is below 60 degrees or it is raining.

Write a function that takes in the current temperature and a boolean value telling if it is raining. 
This function should return True if Alfonso will wear a jacket and False otherwise.

Try solving this problem using an if statement.
